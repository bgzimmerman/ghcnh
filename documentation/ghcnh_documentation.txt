_
_
cYYYYMMDD.tar.gz
ALTERNATIVELY, if you need data for only one or a few specific stations you can:
- Find the station name and identifier in the "ghcnh-station-list" file (e.g., PHOENIX AP [Airport]
is "USW00023183"); and
- Then download the data file (i.e., the "
.psv" file) for that GHCNh station identifier
(e.g.,
"GHCNh
USW00023183
_
_por.psv" has the data for the whole period of record for the
PHOENIX AP) in the /access folder:
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/oa/global-historical-climatology-network/index.html#hourly/access/
Within the
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/oa/global-historical-climatology-network/index.html#hourly/access/by-year/<year>/ directory there are psv and Parquet directories for station-by-year data files.
See Section III on data file formats.
Within the
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/oa/global-historical-climatology-network/index.html#hourly/access/b
y-station/ directory there are entire period-of-record (“por”) psv files for each station.
On the main access link,
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/oa/global-historical-climatology-network/index.html#hourly/, along
with the /access, /archive and /doc folders, there is an /inventory folder which contains
JSON-formatted station inventory files. These are metadata files used by NCEI access tools that
facilitate searching by aggregating the minimum and maximum dates for elements within each
GHCNh file. These files will likely not be useful for public use.
To view a list of GHCNh station names and geographic coordinates, download the
"ghcnh-station-list.txt” or “ghcnh-station-list.csv” from this /doc folder:
https:/ /www.ncei.noaa.gov/oa/global-historical-climatology-network/index.html#hourly/doc/<files>
The names and coordinates come from dataset inventories provided by the data source
providers. See Section II for details. In addition to the ghcnh station list file, the
“ghcnh-inventory.txt” file provides the total number of records by month for the period of record
associated with each GHCNh station.
II. Format of the “ghcnh-station-list” Files
The ghcnh-station-list.txt (and csv) files provide an inventory of the GHCNh identifiers and
coordinates. The same information is provided in NCEI’s Historical Observing Metadata
Repository (HOMR) database.

HCN/CRN FLAG, 77-79, Character
WMO ID, 81-85, Character
ICAO, 87-90, Character
------------------------------GHCN identifiers are 11 characters beginning with the country’s FIPS 10-4 code (2 characters),
a network code identifying the station numbering system used (1 character), and finally the
station identifier (8 characters). For U.S. stations with a network code of “W” (most airport sites),
the last 5 digits of the GHCN station identifier is the WBAN ID. For example, Chicago’s O’Hare
Airport has a WBAN ID of ‘94846’ and the GHCN identifier is ‘USW00094846’
.
These variables have the following definitions:
ID=the station identification code. Note that the first two
characters denote the FIPS 10-4 country code, the third character
is a network code that identifies the station numbering system
used, and the remaining eight characters contain the actual
station ID.
See ghcn-countries.txt file for a complete list of country codes.
See ghcn-states.txt file for a list of state/province/territory codes.
The network code has the following potential values:
A = Retired WMO Identifier used by the USAF 14th Weather Squadron
U = unspecified (station identified by up to eight alphanumeric characters)
C = U.S. Cooperative Network identification number (last six characters of the GHCN ID)
I = International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) identifier
M = World Meteorological Organization ID (last five characters of the GHCN ID)
N = Identification number used by a National Meteorological or Hydrological Center
partner
L = U.S. National Weather Service Location Identifier (NWSLI)
W = WBAN identification number (last five characters of the GHCN ID)
LATITUDE= latitude of the station (in decimal degrees). North (+); South (-)
LONGITUDE=the longitude of the station (in decimal degrees). East (+); West (-)
ELEVATION=the elevation of the station (in meters, missing = -999.9).
STATE=the U.S. postal code for the state (for U.S. stations only).
NAME=the name of the station.
GSN FLAG=a flag that indicates whether the station is part of the GCOS
Surface Network (GSN). The flag is assigned by cross-referencing
the number in the WMO ID field with the official list of GSN
stations. There are two possible values:
Blank = non-GSN station or WMO Station number not availableGSN = GSN station
HCN/=a flag that indicates whether the station is part of the U.S.
CRN FLAG=Historical Climatology Network (HCN) or U.S. Climate Reference
Network (CRN). There are three possible values:
Blank = Not a member of the U.S. Historical Climatology
or U.S. Climate Reference Networks
HCN CRN = U.S. Historical Climatology Network station
= U.S. Climate Reference Network or U.S. Regional Climate
Network Station
WMO ID=the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) number for the
station. If the station has no WMO number (or one has not yet
been matched to this station), then the field is blank.
III. Format of the Data Files
(A) Pipe-Separated Value (.psv) Data Files
Each station “psv” file is made up of a unique identifier and time step followed by 38 variable
fields, each with 5 associated metadata/attribute fields (see below for further details). All fields
are “pipe” separated (pipe = “|”). Each of the variables and metadata fields are described with
explicit names in a header line at the beginning of each station file. Note that the header length
is quite long and is also pipe delimited.
Pipe-separated (.psv) files can easily be viewed with spreadsheet programs (e.g. Excel) by
specifying the delimiter as a pipe “|”
.
The variable names and attribute fields are described below:
First, each station record is indexed to a single GHCN Station
_
ID and accompanying
Station
_
name, Latitude, Longitude and Elevation, which were extracted from metadata provided
by one or more data sources. Each observation is also indexed to a single Year, Month, Day,
Hour and Minute in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Following the identifier, coordinates and
time stamp for the observation, there are 38 sets of observations for 38 variables and their
accompanying metadata/attributes as follows:

column names are provided in Section X “Columns and Headers in PSV Files” below.
(B) Parquet Format Data Files
Parquet is an open-source file format with easily-indexed columns designed for efficient data
storage and retrieval. These files can be read easily using Python.

Note: Since up to 3 cloud layers can be reported, the full state of the sky can best be
determined by the last layer's value. In other words if three layers are reported and the
third layer uses BKN then the total state of sky is BKN which is similar in definition to
“mostly cloudy.
” OVC is similar to “cloudy” or overcast and FEW or SCT is similar to“partly cloudy.
” In cases where there are more than 3 cloud layers, the highest layers will
not be reported.
Values in oktas:
CLR:00 None, SKC or CLR
FEW:01 One okta - 1/10 or less but not zero

Blank = no measurement information applicable
XX-hr-accum = where XX is the number of hours for the precipitation
accumulation period.
g = a carry-over measurement flag from the DSI-3240 dataset
which was used only on the very first hour of the month
if there was zero precipitation during that hour. The purpose
of this flag was mainly to indicate that the station was
functional and reporting during the month. Normally in
DSI-3240, zero precipitation amounts were not included in the
data file in order to save space. This HPD dataset does
include zero precipitation totals, both those assumed from
the DSI-3240 dataset and those determined from the digital
recordings of bucket level data.
Z = represents an "assumed" zero precipitation total. Usually
these are values from the DSI-3240 dataset. The rule in that
dataset was to "assume" a zero total for any hour wherenothing else was reported or indicated for that hour as long
as the very first hour of the month had a non-zero amount or
a zero amount with the "g" measurement flag. Zero amounts
were omitted from the DSI-3240 dataset in order to save disk
space. We are not concerned with that anymore.
E = Evaporation may have occurred. Data may or may not be reliable.
This flag was used during the period 1984-1993.

VI. List of Quality Check Codes
Table 3: QC (code varies by source)
A general set of quality control checks is applied to a subset of variables after all sources are
integrated into a set of unique period of record station files. These checks are based on those
described in Dunn et al. (2016) (https://gi.copernicus.org/preprints/gi-2016-9/gi-2016-9.pdf). In
addition, GHCNh preserves the Quality Control information of its component (legacy) sources.
The set of general flags that apply to the integrated set of sources and the variables
temperature, dew

_
temperature, station
level
_
_pressure, sea

Note: In some cases, the quality code is shown as '9-Missing'
. This simply means that there
was no quality code provided by the data source and can be interpreted as a blank field. In
future versions of GHCNh,
'9-Missing' will be replaced with a blank field for all sources.

For these sources, relative humidity and wet-bulb temperature are not directly measured, and
instead, are derived from other measured variables. These can have the following QC flags:
o - Out of range (relative humidity only - with values < 1 or > 100)
f - Suspect or Error flags for 1 or more of the input measurements
Legacy Codes for Source 382 for precipitation (as given in C-HPD documentation)
Blank = did not fail any quality assurance check
X = failed global extreme exceedance check
N = failed negative precipitation check
Y = failed state extreme exceedance check (performed on daily totals)
K = failed streak/frequent-value check
G = failed gap check
O = failed climatological outlier check
Z = flagged as a result of an official Datzilla investigationA = The value is not an hourly precipitation total but rather
an accumulation total for a period greater than an hour in
duration and lasting through the end of this hour.
(See measurement flags "a" and "
.
" for the beginning time of
the accumulation period and times during the accumulation
period, respectively.) Accumulations across multiple hours
exist only from the legacy DSI-3240 data source.
M = represents the associated value at this observation time is
missing in the DSI-3240 dataset and no alternate data source
is available. This is a carry-over indicator from DSI-3240 to
allow the user to distinguish between missing and deleted
data in that older system. (See the "D" quality flag.)
However, the most consistent way to identify hours of missing
data across the entire dataset is to test if the
precipitation value is equal to the special missing value
of -9999.
D = represents the associated value at this time was deleted by
the DSI-3240 processing system. Usually this was done
manually by a trained meteorological technician who made the
decision using ancillary information and experience.
Q = a carry-over quality flag the legacy DSI-3240 data source.
Prior to 1996: Indicates value failed an extreme value test
(value will be present); data are to be used with caution.
Extremes tests were:
1) If the value was not an accumulated precipitation total,
the value failed the one-hour statewide 100-year return
period precipitation.
2) If the value was an accumulated precipitation total,
the value failed the 24-hour statewide extreme
precipitation total. This flag was assigned during a 1997
NCDC rehabilitation of the 1900-1995 DSI-3240 archive.
Since January 1996: A single erroneous datum (value will be
present). Lowest data resolution is hourly. This flag is
rarely used in DSI-3240 since 1996.
q = a carry-over quality flag the legacy DSI-3240 data source.
Used since January 1996. An hourly value excludes one or
more 15 minute periods. Lowest data resolution is 15 minutes.
R = a carry-over quality flag the legacy DSI-3240 data source.
Used since January 1996. Indicates data values are suspect
with regard to the times or period of occurrence.
Legacy Codes for Source 345 (for relative humidity and wind speed only):
0-Good
1-Issue (field-length overflow)3-Error (erroneous data)
VII. List of Report Type and Source Flag Codes
For some sources, the report
_
type columns for each element are truncated to 10 characters.
They combine the report type code and an abbreviated source flag code with an underscore
(“
_
”) in between. For example, the report
_
type “AUTO
_
4-USA” refers to the report type code
“AUTO” and the source flag code “4-USAF-sfc-hrly”
.

VIII. Present Weather Code DescriptorsTable 5(a-c): Present Weather Element and Measurement Codes
Weather codes (AU / AW / MW) describe precipitation or obstructions to vision occurring at the
time of observation. It is not uncommon for one type of element to be reported without another.
In other words, it is possible to have an AU element without an AW element or MW element.
Depending on equipment used at the location, some automated stations report AW codes either
with or instead of AU codes. Manually augmented stations report MW codes either with or
instead of AU and AW codes. Definitions of element and measurement codes:

“Hourly” Precipitation Measurements
For the precipitation totals coming from METARs (Meteorological Aerodrome Reports) from
AWOS/ASOS reports, there are usually routine FM-15 messages that are transmitted at a
standard time (at the end of the hour: at or after minute 45) for a particular station. In many
cases, the report is hourly and in general is no longer than hourly. For the standard hourly
reports, there can be METAR SPECI (FM-16) reports transmitted at other (non-standard) times,
when conditions change that can affect aviation during the hour between the routine messages.
Some airport sites routinely report more frequently than once per hour (e.g, at 20 minute
intervals), even when conditions are not changing. When multiple observations are transmitted
within the hour, the precipitation totals represent a running total for that hour. To extract the total
precipitation for a particular hour, the last report should be used.
An example of routine (FM-15) and interim/special reports (FM-16) is provided below.
METAR KBYY 251255Z 01007KT 7SM -RA BKN020 OVC050 22/21 A2976 RMK AO2 T02320216;
METAR KBYY 251315Z 30008G28KT 3/4SM -RA OVC009 21/20 A2984 RMK AO2 P0065 T02230214;
METAR KBYY 251335Z 35013G18KT 1/2SM +RA BKN005 OVC008 19/19 A2986 RMK AO2 P0170
T01980197;
METAR KBYY 251355Z 01008KT 4SM RA SCT007 BKN048 OVC060 18/18 A2984 RMK AO2 P0186
T01920192In this case there are two METAR SPECIs after the for hour 13 after the 12:55 UTC routine
message. Rainfall amounts are noted by the P groups highlighted above. Precipitation totals
are:
P0065 in the 13:15 report means 0.65 inches of rain (16.5 mm) since the last routine METAR
(likely since 12:55 UTC)
P0170 in the 13:35 report means 1.70 inches of rain (43.2 mm) since the last routine METAR
P0186 in the 13:55 report means 1.86 inches of rain (47.2 mm) since the last routine METAR
For the intermediate reports:
P0170 at 13:35 UTC indicates that an additional 1.05 inches/26.7 mm (1.70”
between 13:15 UTC and 13:35 UTC.
P0186 at 13:55 UTC indicates that an additional 0.16 inches/4.1 mm (1.86”
between 13:35 UTC and 13:55 UTC.
- 0.65”) of rain fell
- 1.70”) of rain fell
The most straightforward way to extract the hourly total for stations with METAR reports like this
one is to take the last report for the hour. The standard reporting time varies somewhat from
station to station, but is obvious as the most common minute closest to the end of the hour.
There are multiple sources that contain METAR observations. For the USA these include 343,
335, 220, 221, 223. Prior to 1996, SA (Surface Airways) and SAO reports were used prior to
METAR adoption in North America and globally before around 1981. These reports have similar
rules to METAR. The precipitation

X. Columns and Headers in PSV Files
Files in the /by-station and /by-year access directories have a slightly different format. The
station period-of-record (POR) files in the /by-station directory have 238 columns and include
individual columns for Year, Month, Day, Hour, and Minute. The yearly station files in the
/by-year directory have a total column count of 234 with a single column “DATE” in ISO format
(example: 2024-01-01T02:00:00).Column
